# Obsidian Latex Renderer

This plugin renders codeblocks with the label `latex` to SVGs and displays them inline in the note on preview using pdftex and pdf2svg.

Note: This requires the pdftex and pdf2svg to be installed on your system. It will not work without them.

## Recommended Installers
(I used these for development)
- Miktex: https://miktex.org/
- pdf2svg2.bat: https://community.jalios.com/jcms/jc2_183627/en/pdf2svg2-bat-script
